description: The Earth's atmosphere is showcased in this highly oblique shot of the
  Earth taken from space. The atmosphere, composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent
  oxygen and 1 percent other constituents, shields us from falling meteors, as well
  as nearly all harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars. The upper atmosphere
  also contributes to weather and climate on Earth. Public domain; Courtesy of NASA/JPL/UCSD/JSC.
