## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _1.84 Atmospheric Chemistry_ as it was taught by Professor Jesse Kroll in Fall 2013.

This class provides a detailed survey of the chemical reactions occurring in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, with a particular focus on those important for climate and air quality. The emphasis of the class is on the reactivity of key classes (families) of atmospheric species, with chemical/mechanistic complexity steadily increasing over the course of the semester. The emphasis of the lectures is on current topics of interest and results from the recent literature.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

To have a working understanding of the most important reactions (and their broad implications) in atmospheric chemistry, so that these can be applied within a wider context (laboratory/field measurements, modeling, etc).

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lecture

- Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
- The midterm exam and final project presentations took place during class sessions in lieu of lecture.

### Out of Class
